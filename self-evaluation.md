1. On a scale of 1-10 I am probably around a 6 or 7 in confidence when it comes to arrays.
2. I need to do more reading on the methods as well as keep brushing up on the git workflow and coding abbreviations people use because I find myself getting even more confused sometimes when people are trying to help me.
3. Is it more convenient to work mostly out of the terminal or VS code when working with arrays? Does it matter?
